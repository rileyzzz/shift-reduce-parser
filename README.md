TO USE:
No compilation or package management required, everything is standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
To run, simply open an http server in the root folder of this repository and navigate to localhost in your chosen browser.
Tested in Chrome 112.0.5615.138.

Opening index.html directly in a browser will work, however due to CORS policy the initial demo table will fail to load; it is recommended that you use an HTTP server.
